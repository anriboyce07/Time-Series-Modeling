This can be due to the first and fourth quarters is that Australia is experiencing their warmer seasons so more people travel between those times and the first and third quarter are the winter seasons so many do not travel as much.

#The naive forecast places the most importance on the most recent input of a data set. This is useful when only the most recent data is relevant and historical data is irrelevant. The worst accuracy measure for this model would be the RMSE with a 12.5191 percent chance of an error. The best would be the MASE measure with a 1.312846 chance of error.

#The exponential smoothing method uses a moving avg system where most recent data will be more significant while oldest data will have less significance when making the forecast. This is useful as this model still considers all the data but allocates weights to make sure the forecast is accurate in retrospect. The best accuracy measure is the MASE with 0.7476 chance of error in its prediction. The worst is the RMSE with 7.642 chance of error.

#The Holt-Winters method uses the avg, slope, and seasonality pattern in order to forecast. This is useful because this model is especially accurate with data that shows seasonality and trend. The best accuracy measure is MASE with .7555 and the worst is RMSE with 7.6956.

#The data of the arrivals from the US to Australia shows a seasonal pattern that shows a positive slope towards the 1st and 4th quarter and a negative slope towards the 2nd and 3rd quarter. This can be due to Australia having warming seasons during the 1st and 4th quarters of the year and the 2nd and 3rd quarters being colder for traveling. Throughout the years there has been an upwards trajectory until around 2000 where the amount of travel has stayed within a similar range staying relatively flat. Based on my analysis the next 2 years would remain in a similar range keeping the pattern relatively flat. Based on the most recent output of 2012 Q3 the Naive forecast with a residual of .84 was the closest in its prediction then it was exponential smoothing forecast with a residual of -5.96, lastly Holt-Winters forecast with a residual of -7.77.
