#The main job characteristics the participants thought were the most important was enjoying the work, 64, high income, 26, and opportunities for Advancement, 18. With the majority of the participants wanting to work in an environment that allows them to enjoy their work.

#51 participants said they had a very good relationship with their coworkers and 49 said they were good. It is also very important to note that zero participants have said they had a very bad relation with their coworkers. This shows how the workers are close together and can collaborate and rely on each other.

#This graph shows that a majority of all participants are satisfied with their work but it is important to note that there was no workers who worked with the company for more than 30 years responded they were dissatisfied, with a majority of those responds being from participants who worked for less than 10 years.

plot(as.numeric(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$JobCharacteristic), Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Age, main = "Correlation between Age and Important Job Characteristic", xlab = "Job Characteristics", ylab = "Age")

#This is no clear correlation between age and job characteristics but it is interesting to see how only those between 30-45 have responded they saw flexible hours at work being an important characteristics. This can be inferred due to during this age range many major life situations tend to occur like growing a family.
