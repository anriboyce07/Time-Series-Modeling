#Data Dictionary
#Year         The year of the international tourism expenditures
#Expenditures The amount of US Expenditures on international tourism (in millions)

#Data Collection Methodology
#This data is used from the World Bank Group and their analysis of US international tourism expenditures between 1995-2020. They defined international tourism as "expenditures of international outbound visitors in other countries, including payments to foreign carriers for international transport. These expenditures may include those by residents traveling abroad as same-day visitors." The data is represented in US dollars.

#I chose this data set as it shows an interesting perspective of how the US responds to different economic situations across the years and how that effects their international tourism expenditures.

#The best model to use for this data set would have to be the Moving Average model due to its properties in assigning weights in past data to apply to the forecast. 2020 was a year that was not predictable and it shows within the data set the effects it has on international tourism expenditures in the US. So using the Moving average gave a good forecast prediction that took into account that 2020 was an outlier year but has a lasting effect on the years proceeding it.
